江南好，风景旧曾谙。日出江花红胜火，春来江水绿如蓝。能不忆江南？

第一篇文章,感谢[Alittfre](https://github.com/Alittfre/vitepress-theme-bluearchive)提供的VitePress模板.

## Headers

```markdown
# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

# Alt-H1

## Alt-H2
```

## Emphasis

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item

- Unordered sub-list.

1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
2. Ordered sub-list
3. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

* Paragraph In unordered list

  For example like this.

Common Paragraph with some text.
And more text.
```

## Links

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://hexo.io
[1]: https://hexo.io/docs/
[link text itself]: https://hexo.io/api/
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting'
alert(s)
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
